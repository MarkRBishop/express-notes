## Installation
Open the app at the URL and begin

## Usage
When you first open the URL you will be directed towards a landing button, click "Get Started". Afterwards, there will be two input lines. One is an input for the title of your note and below is the note body (or text) of the note. After typing anything into either input forms to create a note, you'll notice a button for save and a button for clear will appear in the top right hand corner. Once you've completed your note and pressed save, your note will appear in a bar to the left hand side of the screen along with a delete (trashcan) icon. If you click on any of your saved notes, they will appear larger in center text areas. Of course if you click the delete button, they will be removed from your list of notes.
